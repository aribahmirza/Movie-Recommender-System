# Movie-Recommender-System
This project builds a content-based movie recommendation system. It loads and merges movie data, cleans it by extracting genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews. These features are processed, space-removed, and combined into 'tags'. Tags are lowercased, vectorized, and cosine similarity is used to recommend similar movies.
